# I commented some lines that were not (yet) relevant to the project to ensure a limited scope.
# We may need to consider what we want to do for files like README and so on, although we can hopefully assume
# everyone has a proper editor these days.

# Set default behaviour, in case users don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files we want to always be normalized and converted 
# to native line endings on checkout.
# *.c text
# *.h text

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
# *.sln text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
# *.png binary
# *.jpg binary

# Some unix specific files should always have LF line endings to ensure proper packaging, irrespective of the platform
*.sh text eol=lf
